# Node-RED

## External Access

An Ingress is created during the installation process. To access your Node-RED use http://nodered.YOUR_CLUSTER_ID.k8s.imaginekube.com

If you want to change the hostname or modify the ingress, edit it with

```
kubectl edit ingress nodered
```

**There is no user authentication by default**, please consider, at least, using Basic Authentication to protect your Node-RED instance.

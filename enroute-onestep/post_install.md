## EnRoute-OneStep Kubernetes Native API Gateway - An Envoy-Powered API Gateway
EnRoute will create enroute-demo service of type LoadBalancer which will launch a [Imagine Load Balancer](https://www.imaginekube.com/load-balancers) (at an additional charge).

[EnRoute-OneStep](https://getenroute.io) is a lightweight shim on Envoy proxy that makes it extremely easy to secure and route traffic destined to microservices running inside Kubernetes Cluster.

EnRoute-OneStep can be programmed by a developer using one command. Policy Overlays provide a meschanism to Operations teams to retain control and specify shared policy.

## Getting Started

[Getting started](https://getenroute.io/docs/getting-started-enroute-ingress-controller/) with EnRoute-OneStep involves running [only one command](https://getenroute.io/docs/one-step-ingress/)

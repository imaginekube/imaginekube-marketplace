## Chaos Mesh -  A Chaos Engineering Platform for Kubernetes

### Usage instruction

See the [documentations](https://chaos-mesh.org/docs)

### Log in Chaos Dashboard

Chaos Dashboard supports a security mode, which requires users to login with a token generated by Kubernetes. Each token is linked to a `service account`. You can only perform operations within the scope as allowed by the role that is associated with the service account. By default, the security mode is enabled when using helm to install Chaos Mesh. You can refer this [documentation](https://chaos-mesh.org/docs/user_guides/dashboard#log-in) to create the account and the token. 

If you want to create the account later and start using Chaos Dashboard quickly, you can use the token of Chaos Mesh. Get the token by executing the command: 

```shell
kubectl -n chaos-testing describe secret $(kubectl -n chaos-testing get secret | grep chaos-controller-manager | awk '{print $1}')
```

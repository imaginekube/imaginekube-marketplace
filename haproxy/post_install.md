## Haproxy - Ingress controller

### External access to your services

HAProxy is free, open source software that provides a high availability load balancer and proxy server for TCP and HTTP-based applications.To use it for your applications all you have to do is apply a YAML file like the one below to handle ingress:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: yourapp-ingress
  namespace: default
spec:
  rules:
    - host: www.example.com
      http:
        paths:
          - path: /
            pathType: Prefix
            backend:
              service:
                name: service-name
                port:
                  number: 8080
```

This will open up http://www.example.com (assuming you pointed that non-real domain record to your cluster's IPs) to the whole world.
